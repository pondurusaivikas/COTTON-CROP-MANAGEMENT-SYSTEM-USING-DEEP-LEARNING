# COTTON CROP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING

## Overview

The **Cotton Crop Management System** is an AI-powered platform designed to assist farmers in managing cotton crops more efficiently. Leveraging deep learning models, the system analyzes crop data, detects diseases, and provides actionable insights for optimizing cotton growth and yield. This project aims to empower farmers with accurate predictions, early detection of diseases, and data-driven recommendations to enhance crop productivity.

## Features

- **Crop Disease Detection**: Utilize deep learning models to detect various diseases affecting cotton crops from images.
- **Yield Prediction**: Predict potential crop yield based on historical and real-time environmental data.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Collect and analyze data from the field, such as temperature, humidity, and soil conditions.
- **Recommendation System**: Provide suggestions for pest control, irrigation, and fertilizer use based on data analysis.
- **Dashboard for Farmers**: User-friendly interface to monitor crop health, get recommendations, and view prediction results.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (or PyTorch)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Database**: MySQL / SQLite (for storing user data and crop information)
- **Data Processing**: OpenCV (for image processing), Pandas (for data analysis)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS (or any cloud platform for hosting the application)

## Prerequisites

To run the Cotton Crop Management System locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- OpenCV
- MySQL or SQLite
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COTTON-CROP-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING.git
cd COTTON-CROP-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Database

- Create a MySQL or SQLite database.
- Configure your database connection in the `config.py` file by adding the necessary credentials.
- Initialize the database by running the provided SQL scripts located in the `/db` directory.

### 5. Train the Deep Learning Model (Optional)

If you want to retrain the deep learning models:

- Navigate to the `/model_training` directory.
- Use the dataset (can be found in `/datasets` folder or add your own) to train the models for disease detection and yield prediction.
- Run the training scripts:
  
  ```bash
  python train_disease_detection_model.py
  python train_yield_prediction_model.py
  ```

Pre-trained models are provided and can be found in the `/models` folder.

### 6. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 7. (Optional) Deploy with Docker

To deploy using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t cotton-crop-management-system .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 cotton-crop-management-system
   ```

Access the app at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Disease Detection**: Upload images of cotton leaves, and the system will detect if the crop is infected by common diseases like Leaf Curl Virus, Bollworm, etc.
2. **Yield Prediction**: Input environmental data (e.g., rainfall, temperature, soil moisture) and get a prediction for the expected yield of the cotton crop.
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Monitor real-time data from sensors, and get recommendations on crop health, irrigation, and pest control.

## Data and Model

- The dataset used for training the disease detection model includes images of healthy and infected cotton crops.
- The yield prediction model is based on historical crop yield data combined with environmental factors.
